# Information-Storage-Retrieval
Information Storage and Retrieval Course
This course provided an in-depth understanding of data science, database management, and information retrieval techniques. Key topics covered:

ðŸ“Œ Data Science & DBMS Fundamentals

50 Years of Data Science â€“ Exploration of the evolution of data science and its impact.
Data Science vs. Statistics â€“ Comparative analysis of methodologies and applications.
DBMS Functions â€“ Overview of data storage, retrieval, and management.
SQL Commands â€“ DDL, DML, and DCL with practical examples.
ðŸ“Œ Database Management & Implementation

Designed and implemented a Hospital Management System, including:
Creating databases and tables (patients, doctors, appointments).
Defining primary, secondary, and foreign keys.
Executing multi-relation queries for data retrieval.
Creating users and managing privileges for data manipulation.
Performing database backup and recovery.
ðŸ“Œ Information Retrieval & Boolean Models

Boolean Retrieval Model â€“ Structured search techniques for document retrieval.
Query Processing & Optimization â€“ Implemented inverted index methods for efficient search.
Document Parsing & Tokenization â€“ Text preprocessing techniques for structured search.
Phrase Querying â€“ Advanced search techniques using phrase-based retrieval.
ðŸ“Œ Evaluation Metrics in Information Retrieval

Precision, Recall, and F-Score â€“ Metrics for retrieval effectiveness.
Mean Average Precision (MAP) â€“ Performance measurement across queries.
Kappa Statistic & Coherence Score â€“ Evaluation of agreement in classification.
ðŸ“Œ Big Data & Similarity Measures

MapReduce â€“ Large-scale data processing.
Jaccard & Cosine Similarity â€“ Measuring text similarity using normalized vectors.
TF-IDF â€“ Term weighting for information retrieval.
ðŸ“Œ Project: Library Management System

Developed a Library Management System to manage books, users, and transactions efficiently using DBMS and SQL queries.
This course enhanced my ability to design efficient data retrieval systems, optimize queries, and apply machine learning techniques to structured and unstructured data. ðŸš€
